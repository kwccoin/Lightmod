## Introduction

Lightmod is an all-in-one tool for full stack Clojure. Do `boot run` for development and `boot build` to make a jar file. To build, JDK 11 or above is required.

## Licensing

All files that originate from this project are dedicated to the public domain. I would love pull requests, and will assume that they are also dedicated to the public domain.
